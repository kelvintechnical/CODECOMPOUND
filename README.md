Debugging Steps
Let‚Äôs insert console.log statements to track the values of userCode and expectedCode during execution.

Update the checkCode function as follows:

const checkCode = () => {
console.log("User Input (trimmed):", userCode.trim());
console.log("Expected Code:", expectedCode);

// Check the user's input against the expected code
if (userCode.trim() === expectedCode) {
console.log("Input matches expected code.");
setFeedback("‚úÖ Correct! Great job!");
setCodeExplanation("This line prints 'Hello, World!' to the console.");
setProjectCode((prev) => [...prev, userCode.trim()]); // Adds the correct code to the project
setUserCode(""); // Clears the text area for the next line
} else {
console.log("Input does NOT match expected code.");
setFeedback("‚ùå Incorrect. Try again!‚ùå");
setCodeExplanation(""); // Clear the explanation on incorrect input
}
};

How CodeCompound Will Work
Choose a Senior Project Idea:
The user selects a challenging project (e.g., "Build a Machine Learning-Powered To-Do App").

Break It into 19 Smaller Modules:
The app breaks the project into independent modules, such as:

Module 1: Learn basic React components.
Module 2: Set up a Python backend with Flask.
Module 3: Connect React and Flask.
... and so on.
Teach Step-by-Step:
Each module includes:

Code Examples: Clear, beginner-friendly guidance.
Challenges: Interactive exercises.
Feedback: Validate user inputs and provide suggestions.
Capstone Project:
Once users complete all modules, they combine their knowledge to build the final project.

Portfolio Builder:
Users can showcase all 20 projects, along with the capstone, on a shareable portfolio.

Technologies for CodeCompound
Frontend: React (for user interface).
Backend: Python with Flask or Django (for APIs and database handling).
Styling: Tailwind CSS.
Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB (to store users‚Äô progress and projects).
Interactive Lessons: Markdown-based content rendered with React components.
Deployment:
Frontend: Vercel or Netlify.
Backend: Heroku or AWS.
Step 1: Plan the App's Features
Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôll build:

User Dashboard:
Tracks progress through the 19 modules and capstone project.

Project Selector:
Allows users to pick a senior project idea from categories (e.g., web, mobile, AI).

Interactive Lessons:
Displays lessons with embedded code editors for hands-on practice.

Project Showcase:
Lets users export their completed projects to share on GitHub or LinkedIn.

Gamification:
Add badges for completing modules or projects to keep it fun!

Step 2: App Setup
Would you like to start by:

Setting up the frontend (React + Tailwind)?
Setting up the backend (Flask/Django)?
Designing the database for user progress and project tracking?

6. Line-By-Line training. It will tell the user what we need to do next, then It will ask the user to type in the line of code. It will check the syntax for correctness before moving forward

   Got it, Kelvin! The Line-By-Line Training feature is an excellent addition that will make CodeCompound both interactive and effective for teaching beginners. Here‚Äôs how we can incorporate this feature into the app:

Step 1: Plan the Line-By-Line Training Workflow
Explain the Step:
Display what the user needs to do (e.g., "Create a function to add two numbers").

Guide Code Input:
Provide a code editor for the user to type their response.

Check Syntax:
Validate their input:

Check for syntax errors.
Compare their code against expected solutions.
Feedback:

Correct Code: Allow the user to proceed.
Incorrect Code: Highlight mistakes and provide hints or corrections.
Encourage:
Offer positive feedback for each correct step, building confidence.

Step 2: Technologies for Line-By-Line Training
Frontend:

CodeMirror or Monaco Editor: A rich code editor that supports syntax highlighting and live validation.
React: For rendering the editor and lessons.
Backend:

Python Flask or Django: Handle validation and store progress.
Linter Libraries: Use Python libraries (e.g., pylint) or JavaScript linters to check code syntax.
Live Validation:

For Python: Use exec() safely in a sandbox environment.
For JavaScript: Use eval() cautiously with sanitization.
Step 3: Features for Line-By-Line Training
Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôll design it:

Interactive Editor:
Users type directly into the embedded editor.

Real-Time Validation:
A backend endpoint validates syntax and returns feedback instantly.

Hints and Corrections:
If the user makes a mistake, provide:

A description of what went wrong.
A hint to guide them toward the correct answer.
Progress Tracking:
Save their progress so they can pick up where they left off.

Step 4: Code a Simple Example
Let‚Äôs create a small example:

Frontend: A React component with a code editor.
Backend: A Flask API to validate the user‚Äôs code.
